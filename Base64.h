//Base64.h - Our Encryption Functions. While Base64 can be easily decrypted, we are
//making modifications to it so it can't be decrypted as easily

/*
base64 encoding is used to convert binary data into a text-like format
1st step is to take the 3 bytes (24 bits) of binary data and split into
four parts of 6 bits.  That's why its called Base64 (2^6=64): because
it's only printing the first 64 characters from the ASCII table
this prevents from any special characters being printed.
2nd: now we have these 4 sections of 6 bits, which we can convert to decimal values
3rd: lastly we then convert these 4 decimal values to ascii values
note: if the data is not a multiple of 3, the data gets padded with "="
